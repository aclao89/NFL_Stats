Every data analysis starts with an idea and/or problem. The following step usually involves the crucial element: data. Data can be found everywhere and can be stored in various formats and data types.

For those of us who love diving into data, there are lots of resources to attain this part of the process. Whether itâ€™s through Kaggle, Data World, or search engines powered Google, data is easily available. However, sometimes the datasets pulled from the mentioned resources might not have all the data pertinent for a thorough analysis.

This issue of getting incomplete or insufficient data brought me to explore web scraping to create a dataset. I have worked on an [basketball analytics project](https://github.com/aclao89/NBA_All_Stars). The project was an analysis of NBA All-Star selections from 2000 to 2016 to examine the commonalities and differences over time. As I loaded and cleaned the dataset pulled from Kaggle, I realized the dataset did not have all the stats pertinent to my analysis. To avoid the same issue, I went directly to a reputable resource and did further research to find ways to pull data directly from a website.

For this project, I went to [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/); this site is an encyclopedia for all NFL stats. My research resulted in discovering a great Python library called [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
